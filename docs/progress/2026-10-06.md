# Jadpo daily progress — 2026-10-06

Updated 2026-10-06T07:28:16+01:00 · figures reflect the recorded roadmap.

The golden Todo harness now checks 18 original case IDs through real HTTP on both databases. Worker crash recovery and separate scan/delivery limits have scoped evidence; full golden completion remains open.

## At a glance

| Measure | Recorded count |
|---|---:|
| Completed since task-ID tracking began | 19 |
| Remaining open tasks | 84 |
| Of those, conditional / not activated | 28 |
| In progress | 10 |
| Marked ready for work | 4 |
| Queued behind dependencies | 19 |
| Decision / blocked / external / review | 23 |

Completed counts cover the reorganised roadmap, not all earlier development. Older capabilities are in the history; there is no reliable whole-project percentage.

## Delivered

- The independently reviewed supporting harness records 36 passed and 52 unexecuted case/backend entries; a fresh combined verifier passed 67/67. [Checkpoint](../work-plans/golden-delivery-planning.md#checkpoint).
- Separate generated workers exercise crash recovery, stale-claim fencing, uncertainty containment and 500-row continuation; complete checked worker conformance is still in progress. [Recovery review](../../tests/validation/rm307-independent-generated-recovery-review.json).
- The owner approved separate 60-second execution / renewable 40-second lease profiles for each delivery and the whole reminder scan. [Decision](../decision-register.md#golden-reminder-execution-and-lease-profile--2026-10-06).

## Since the previous report

Compared with 2026-10-05: 0 newly recorded complete; 0 added or reopened; 0 removed/reclassified without completion evidence.

## Planning and implementation

- **83** open tasks have an explicitly recorded plan; **1** is recorded as needing planning and **0** as needing input for their plan.
- **0** still need their planning status assessed. Existing design documents may already cover some of them.
- **56** non-conditional tasks remain to deliver; **28** more are conditional. This includes coding, decisions, testing and external work—not just implementation.
- A saved plan does not make a task execution-ready; its dependencies still apply.

## Remaining work by epic

| Epic | Open tasks | Conditional | Estimated effort for non-conditional tasks |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| E01 — Complete the golden todo | 3 | 0 | 2.5–10h |
| E02 — Close language and tooling gaps | 19 | 5 | 10.25–40.75h + 1 unestimated |
| E03 — Add reviewed services and durable jobs | 7 | 3 | 7–28h |
| E04 — Qualify transactions and deployment readiness | 9 | 5 | 5–20h |
| E05 — Complete engineering validation | 6 | 0 | 6–24h |
| E06 — Make policy approval enforceable and reviewable | 5 | 0 | 5.5–22h |
| E07 — Complete independent assurance and user evidence | 6 | 0 | 1.5–6h + 3 unestimated |
| E08 — Test the thesis with order/payment and TypeScript | 9 | 0 | 11–44h + 2 unestimated |
| E09 — Qualify alternative runtime candidates | 6 | 1 | 4–16h |
| E10 — Research the public documentation site | 5 | 5 | — |
| E11 — Developer console and MCP runtime inspection | 8 | 8 | — |
| E12 — Explore application contracts and frontend integration | 1 | 1 | — |

Estimates are provisional agent session hours for open tasks, not days or a delivery date. They are task forecasts, not measured remaining time on partially completed work. Each epic excludes other epics’ prerequisites; conditional estimates and external waiting are excluded. Unestimated work remains additional.

## Next milestone

Continue the parallel loop: pagination/relation/repeat-deletion acceptance cases, worker retry/cancellation, and checked public worker integration before complete golden acceptance.

## Input needed

No current blocking owner decision recorded. Both scan and individual-delivery limits are approved.
